## Personal information
- ID: Participant 3
- Years of professional experience: 6 years
- Have you used a scenario-based method for real-world projects before? No.
- How familiar are you with scenario based methods in general on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is not familiar and 5 very familiar? 2
- How familiar are you with service- or microservice-based systems in general on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is not familiar and 5 very familiar? 3

## Creating system
Duration for creating the system: 4 min.

Observations:
The participant starts very fast. After the step to create the system, the button for creating the service is found immediately. There is a short mistake between Save System and Save Service. The participant creates the services according to the task description and the ripples during the creation of a service.

How easy was it to create the system on a scale of 1 to 5, where 1 is easy and 5 is hard? 1

What was easy or hard in creating a system?
Everything was easy. The user interface shows a good overview and the names of the buttons are clear. The stepper was also good.

What are your thoughts about defining dependencies in this way?
A visualization of the created system would be very helpful. A drag-and-drop method to fill in the dependencies between the services would also be very helpful. For both options it is ideal to create the dependencies manually and graphically.

## Creating scenarios
Duration for creating the scenarios: 15 min.

Observations:
The scrolling of the categories is not clear. There were also difficulties in choosing the most appropriate category. The participant finds the button to create changes immediately. At first it is not clear what a ripple effect is. The participant reads the info button. Then he knows what to do. He creates his own categories. After the third scenario, a learning effect seems to occur. The participant understands that he can create more than one change per scenario. It's confusing to edit changes and add new ones. It's not even clear when the expansion panel is open.

Do you find it useful to categorize scenarios on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is not useful and 5 very useful? 3

What was easy or hard in creating a scenario?
Adding tags instead of categories would be more helpful. In categories, he sees no advantage. The 2-stage system is good. The default categories are helpful. Validating the fields is helpful. Adding a second change looks like you're editing the change at the top. The info text is great.

Do you find the recommended ripples helpful on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is not useful and 5 is very helpful? 4

## Evaluation
Duration for evaluating the system on the scenarios: 3 min.

Observations:
The second menu for selecting a system is very confusing. The last question of the hands-on interview is unclear that affected service is meant.

Which evaluation attributes do you find useful? The information about the overall system is not detailed enough. The table is completely fine. The average cost per scenario is good to decide if a scenario needs to be smaller.

Which evaluation attributes do you find unnecessary? The most difficult and simplest change is not useful in the table. The effective change requires more information. The average cost per service is unnecessary.

Is the evaluation view helpful to evaluate the system on the scenarios on a scale from 1 to 5, where 1 is not helpful and 5 very helpful? 4
